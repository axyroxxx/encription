# encription

This application alows you to send encripted messages or mails. 

The application uses the AES(Advanced Encription Standard) for encripting the text.

On the other side if the user know the password or key only he/she will be able to
decrypt the file 

Also the app allow to decrypt any text using the key.

The encripted calling feature is not added to the applicaiton. 
I am still working on VOIP calls and the diiferent method to encript the calls
